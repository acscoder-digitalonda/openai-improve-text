Now, speaking of upgrades and speaking of rockstars does anybody out here know what Steve Jobs business model was? He told us in his book, but clearly you've been too busy ( add lib to the situation example, saving the world or loaning other people money out)  to have a chance to read it.

His business model wasyou know what, this is kind of a big deal.may I have a drumroll, please?  7:11   His business model was the Beatles, The Beatles. And that's one of my points and the entire premise. Here's his exact quote, check this out.  7:19  Roll Video My model of business is the Beatles, you know, there were four very talented guys who kept each other's negative tendencies in check.

RESPONSE:

Good evening everyone, I'm so glad to be here with you all tonight. Now, I'm sure you've all heard of Steve Jobs and his amazing business model. But do you know what it was? Well, let me give you a hint. It wasn't Thomas Edison, or Warren Buffett, Jack Welch or Oprah Winfrey. It was something a little more...rock star. That's right! His business model was the Beatles! Now, let me quote him directly: "My model of business is the Beatles, you know, there were four very talented guys who kept each other's negative tendencies in check. They balanced each other and their sum was greater than the parts. And that's how I see business. You know, great, great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by us. They're done by a team of people." So here's my challenge to you all: Can you fill in the blank? Great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by a team of people. ( Add audience participation here) Now I may not be as smart as Steve Jobs or as outrageous as a rockstar, but I can certainly dress like one! (Pause for laughter) So let's keep this mindset right now: Nobody wants to be stuck on Windows 95!
