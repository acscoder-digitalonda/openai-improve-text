change. Change is inevitable, its uncomfortable, but if you are going to stand the test of time and become a rock legend, you need to accept that you are going to have to accept change.Now, changing intentionally can sometimes mean that we have to break a few rules, which rock stars do very well. But most of us don't. Here's what I mean, there was a time in the music industry when they were terrified about live bootleg recordings cutting into their profits,  but this band actually encouraged their fans to bring recording devices. They even roped off a spot right in front of the stage to give them the best sound in the house. And what did it do? It spread their music farther and wider and made them one of the most iconic bands in the world. It also created a bond with their fans. A bond so strong that it still exists to this day, even after the lead singer has passed on and the band has broken up and who is this band you might be wondering?  39:34   Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia \. ( TRACK AND MUSIC) quote And because of that, it made the Grateful Dead, the most successful touring act of all time. So your C chord, you have to be the ones driving the change. And to do that, that's going to mean changing intentionally on a regular basis. And you're going to have to be the only one that does what you do. So how can you create that kind of bond with your fans, with your customers? And are you the only one who does what you do? Alright, jazz hands ready, and the crowd goes wild.

RESPONSE:

Change is inevitable, and it's uncomfortable, but if you want to be a rock legend, you need to accept it. Now, changing intentionally can sometimes mean breaking a few rules - something rock stars do very well! For example, there was a time in the music industry when they were terrified of live bootleg recordings cutting into their profits. But one band took a different approach: they encouraged their fans to bring recording devices and even roped off a spot in front of the stage to get the best sound. And do you know what happened? It spread their music farther and wider and made them one of the most iconic bands in the world. It also created a bond with their fans so strong that it still exists today, even after the lead singer has passed away and the band has broken up. Who are they? (PAUSE FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT) That's right - The Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia! And because of that, it made the Grateful Dead the most successful touring act of all time. So your C chord (PAUSE FOR LAUGHTER) is to be the ones driving the change. And to do that, that's going to mean changing intentionally on a regular basis. You have to be the only one who does what you do - how can you create that kind of bond with your fans, with your customers? Alright, jazz hands ready (PAUSE FOR LAUGHTER) and let's hear it for change!
