RESPONSE:

Traveling over three and a half million miles on Delta, hundreds of hours backstage with Rockstar CEOs and famous VIPs, this journey eventually led me to the publishing of my first book. In it, I breakdown what separates the good and the great rock and rollers, the business lessons we can learn, and how we can all unlock our inner rockstar in whatever we do in life. As I'm sure you've heard before - there is a rock star inside of everyone that is just waiting to get out. An inner version of yourself that is focused and aligned toward achieving big dreams. And that's what I'm going to talk to you about today: how you can become the best version of yourself, how to turn your life volume up to 11, and how to come together with your team members as a band set out to achieve greatness. Are you ready to turn it up? There are four chords or principles of Rockstar success that are used across the music and business world. If you can implement these rockstar principles into your daily life, you will open yourself up to a world of new possibilities. I know you've accomplished a lot to even be in this room - you are the best of the best - but __________ told me what you've got ahead and I'm 100% certain that what got you here won't get you there. So, let me ask again: Are you committed? Are you ready to turn it up? If so, let's get started!
