service, your customers are going to be your lead singers, they're going to tell everybody how awesome you are. So lead singers, you're going to come in on a six count. Hit the table three times really, really fast. And say. rock. All right, so I'll count you in 567-812-3456 EAS rock 123456123456 All right, great job. Now here's the deal. I know you're holding back because there's gonna be a lot of noise here in about 30 seconds. So EAA rockers, lead singers, you're going to have to shout it out if you're going to be heard above the noise. Okay, now I'm going to bring you in one section at a time. And you're gonna love the song that I chose today, because I thought it was really appropriate with all the messaging and the Yes, and admins rock. So it's from the late grade David boy. And it's called Rebel rebel. Because if you look up rebel in the urban dictionary, this is what it says. A person who doesn't follow the crowd go through everyday motions and does not accept normal behavior. if we're going to drive change, if we're going to have the most awesome band members and take daily massive action on important and not urgent, we got to be the rebels. We got to do things differently. So standby, I'm going to bring you in one table at a time. You're gonna love this version. It was done in 2016. In Italy in a stadium where they did the impossible they brought 1000 musicians together all playing the same song at the same time and playing it loud. Alright.  1:07:21   Standby

RESPONSE:

I'm sure you all know that your customers are the lead singers, they'll be the ones telling everyone how great you are. So I want you to come in on the count of five, hit the table three times, and shout "Rock!" 5-6-7-8-1-2-3-4-5-6 EAA Rock! 1-2-3-4-5-6. Great job! Now, I know you could be holding back, but you're going to need to shout it out if you want to be heard over all the noise. So I'm going to bring you in one section at a time and I've chosen a really appropriate song for today's messaging - Yes And Admins Rock. It's from David Bowie and it's called "Rebel Rebel". If you look up 'Rebel' in the Urban Dictionary, it says a person doesn't follow the crowd and doesn't accept normal behavior - and if we're going to drive change, if we're going to take daily massive action on important but not urgent tasks, then we have to be those rebels. We have to do things differently. So standby, I'm going to bring you in one table at a time and you're going to love this version of Rebel Rebel - it was done in 2016 in Italy with 1000 musicians playing the same song at the same time - it was loud! Alright, standby!
