People often wonder what we've been up to, and I'm here to tell you that it has been nothing short of amazing. That's performance. Alright, hold that thought bass players! Let's talk about the rhythm section - when the song starts to take notice or you start to recognize the melody. It's like the rhythm section is working double time, so who are some of your rhythm people? Think of marketing, PR, HR, project managers, admins, meeting planners - if your company does a lot of events. And I must say, I'd love to meet your meeting planner! Okay, now let's get down to it - rhythm section, double time! 1234567812345678 Don't forget to smile! Alright, great job. Last but certainly not least are our lead singers - Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Madonna, Mick Jagger or Steven Tyler - they're walking the walk and talking the talk. They have a message to convey and they need a strong band around them to help convey it. So think about sales directors, business development and customer service if you have customers. If you do a great job and your company has a superior product then you can be sure that your customers will be satisfied.
