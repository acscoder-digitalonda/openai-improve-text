Improve this speech to have more structure and jokes from the fun quick witted speaker:

But I learned very early the power of leveraging relationships, upgrading my mindset, and working as a team. And my business began to growand so did a cow. And as I was working in radio, my business grew even more and I had to make an executive decision to leverage what I had to take my career further. ( look at the cow and moo)

 While this move to radio was living the dream, I started to see a pattern. Why do some rock stars make one-hit wonders and fade away while others go on to become legends, releasing hit after hit? 

All of these bands were good -  good enough to make a hit heard across America. But only some of them went on to achieve greatness. This fascination led me to a lifelong study of Rock stars. I wanted to see if there was some sort of commonality to their success. It turns out that these legendary artists, on top of being amazing performers, also employed many of the same habits, tools, and strategies to get to and stay at the top. As I learned more about this, I started to see that everyday people working at companies could apply these rock and roll insights. So I started working with some of the biggest companies like Home Depot, IBM, and Delta, delivering these rockstar lessons while giving them an experience of the rock and roll lifestyle I love so much. And the passion just grew even further, taking this experience to 24 countries allowing me to work alongside some of the rock and roll heroes that I study and speak about.  After traveling over three and a half million miles on Delta Plus hundreds of hours backstage with Rockstar CEOs, and famous VIPs this journey was leading me to the publishing of my first book,   In it, I breakdown what separates  the good and the great rock and rollers, the business lessons we can learn and how we can all unlock our inner rockstar in whatever we do in life.     There is a rock star inside of everyone that is just waiting to get out. An inner version of yourself that is focused and aligned toward achieving big dreams. And thats what I'm going to talk to you about today. How you can become the best version of yourself, how to turn your life volume  up to 11 and how to come together  right now  with your team members as a band set out to achieve greatness.  

 There are four chords or principles of Rockstar success that are used across the music and business world. If you can implement these rockstar principles into your daily life you will open yourself up to a world of new possibilities. I know youve accomplished a lot to even be in this room, you are the best of the best, but __________ told me what youve got ahead and Im 100% certain that what got you here, wont get you there. 

I repeat, doing the same thing is not enough, in order to take _____company name______ to the next level, you are going to have to work smarter together as a band to get there. 

So the first question is, are you committed, are ready to turn it up?

If you are ready Turn it up? are ready Hit Me 3 Times.
Today we are going to break some records, not vinyl records, but records that matter
 

Amazing! The cool thing about using these rockstar principles is, you don't have to stay up all night  or trash your hotel room to do it. Yeah. But you can still drive your rental car like a maniac, depending on your expense account. So ladies and  gentlemen, are you ready to get this party started? 

 Did you know that almost every popular song you hear on the radio, you stream or you download is made up of some variation of the exact same four chords? It's true, we're gonna check out a band called the Axis of Awesome where they're playing a bunch of popular tunes all sung over the exact same four chords. So grab your drumsticks, play along and let's see how many of these songs you recognize. Here we go.


 

 These four chords that you just heard are the building blocks or the foundation of becoming a rock star. And when you master them, then you're on your way to becoming an___________Name the Profession/Industry______Rockstar. And today I have broken down these  the four chords of Rockstar success, into  the A, the B, the C and the D chords. But today, we're gonna do them backwards. Why? Anybody care to take a guess? Because we're rockstars and we don't have to play by the rules.

. You know, as .. and, the teams that support you, you  want more than just satisfied customers. you also want  excited teammates, right? You  want raving fans who go out and tell everybody how awesome you  are and what great job you do and how you're  rocking their world, 
But if we're not excited, how can we expect to get everybody else excited? It all starts with each and every one of you here in this room. So I will say and the crowd goes wild and you raise your jazz hands and scream. 
Thank you. Now grab your drumsticks and please welcome to the stage your D Chord

Thank you, Steven Tyler for the Rockstar mating  call. 

Dreams, goals, vision. We've all heard that we have to have them right. The cool thing about rock stars is that they have big, unreasonable dreams. They don't just want to get by, pay the bills, and have a nice retirement. They want to take over the universe and change the world. In Madonna's first appearance on American Bandstand with Dick Clark, he asked her Madonna, what do you hope will happen, not only in 1984 but for the rest of your professional life? What are your dreams? What's left? Madonna answered simply, To rule the world. Big and  unreasonable, you bet. Therefore, Rockstar success requires a big unreasonable dream. And I'm going to argue that your continued success is going to require a big unreasonable dream. Why is a big dream so important?  Because reasonable dreams often get lost. They get buried in the day-today. They dont excite you enough to push through and make them real. Thats why you need a Big Unreasonable Dream. (I call this your B.U.D)These dreams fire you up, push you to the next level and open a new world of possibility and success.  In today's competitive environment, especially coming out of the pandemic,Average is no longer enough. Average dreams come from average people and only produce average results. Average means you may soon be out of a job or out of business.  If you want to become a rock star at work and at home, you need to get crystal clear on your Big Unreasonable Dream. Because when you focus on the Dream, the work to get there all of sudden has a greater purpose. You are a rockstar on your way to accomplish your BUD. You come in fired up because you are working on your BUD. This energy is infectious. To you,Your boss and your team members and everyone else in your band. It's contagious , you have to spread it. So what is your bud? Your big unreasonable dream, most of us have a personal BUDAnd we'll have a professional  BUD but I'm willing to guess that most of your buds are not big enough, you need to 10x them. Because when you 10x your Bud  you start playing up here, that's when you set a new standard for yourself and for your company, and the universe, your mind or as I believe God starts to transpire to make this happen for you. This is your new standard and you work backwards towards your goal.  

I had the privilege to speak with some of you. I spoke with [Name} from [company or Dept]. I asked her what her BUD was. (customization) usually two or three examples.)
And then I spoke with . Thats a BUD
Now speaking of Buds, does anyone remember these guys? ( roll song and slide)	
How in the world did KISS get out of the garage and become rock legends?
