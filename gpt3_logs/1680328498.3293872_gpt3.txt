1:31   Give yourselves a drumstick round of applause. Congratulations You just nailed your first audition..  between you and me, how often have you fantasized about being a rock star? You don't have to answer out loud, but it's okay that you did. Because according to my unofficial research, over 72% of the most unlikely analytical ( industry professionals) do . See -  it doesn't matter what company you work for, or what  industry you're in.  The highest-level achievers are often referred to as the company.Rock Star Oh, come on, I realized this is the final day of the show. But i'm not feeling the love or the volume gotta TURN IT UP up, But just like HR, I believe everybody deserves a 59th second chance. So we're going to re-wind that statement and try it again. And this time to turn it up  
There are millions of musicians, very few rock stars. 
Rock Stars perform at a higher level. They have a bigger vision, they arent afraid of big goals and big dreams. As I look out at the crowd today I see a room full of rock stars. The question is 	how do you stand out> How do you remain relevant? How are you or your teams being heard above the noise?   What you have to look forward to in the next few minutes is an action-packed, highly energized, and engaging show that will give you the instruments you need to achieve boldly in these challenging times - just like a rockstar. 

We're all performers. But we're not all rock stars. Rock Stars perform at a higher level every day. And they think differently. I call it the Rockstar Mindset. Because if you think about it, your brain is a muscle too and if we don't use it, we do what? Lose it and heaven forbid, we would lose our brain in ( city name ) may be our mind but not our brain. So we're going to take the Rockstar Challenge. In just a moment you're going to see some familiar faces pop up on the screen, the nanosecond that you recognize someone I want you to shout their name out, shout it out loud louder than anybody else. So the less intelligent people know who your are

All  eyes on the screen. On your mark, get set. Now live your life that way. Here we go! Starting with say it. Bill Gates, Elon, Oprah, Michael Jordan. Mark Jones. Congratulations, you get to advance to the lightning round a little bit faster. And a little bit louder. Here we go. Starting with Yes, Aerosmith. You too.

5:11  
And now for the two words, double elimination, triple point question, what two words would you use to describe all of these people on the screen? ROCKSTAR because on one side of the screen, we have the industry or business rockstars. And on the other, we have the music rockstars. But they all figured out how to make their businesses rock. 


They, like many of you, started out at an entry-level position or in the garage before they started selling out tours and arenas. But if you could call up any of these people on the screen today, with the exception of Elvis, they would tell you, 

There are 2 reasons they are up there, 1. They all had a big unreasonable dream. 2. They committed to work together with their band or team (yes every rock star has a team) to accomplish that dream no matter what.  

So Thats great Mark, but what does that have to do with me? Well theres something else that I didnt tell you. All these rock stars, just like all these people in business utilize a special mindset to achieve these goals. the rock star mindset, Ive been studying it for 20 years and Im going to show you how you can use the same mindset to accomplish any big goal or dream. I know you have been going over whats coming up in the next quarter and year and I think its safe to say that you all are committed to some pretty big goals.
So it's important that we as rock stars are constantly upgrading our mindset. Why do you need to  upgrade your mindset? Well, we upgrade our technology, a lot of us went out and rushed to get the new iPhone 14. So why wouldn't we constantly upgrade the way we think, buy books, listen to podcasts, attend conferences like this -   because you're upgrading your mindset right now. 

 I mean, people would make fun of you if you were still on Windows 95. Right, (Add audience member name) ? Now, speaking of upgrades and speaking of rockstars does anybody out here know what Steve Jobs business model was? He told us in his book, but clearly you've been too busy ( add lib to the situation example, saving the world or loaning other people money out)  to have a chance to read it. Well, his business model wasn't Thomas Edison, or Warren Buffett, Jack Welch or Oprah Winfrey. His business model wasyou know what, this is kind of a big deal.may I have a drumroll, please?

7:11  
His business model was the Beatles, The Beatles. And that's one of my points and the entire premise. Here's his exact quote, check this out.

7:19  Roll Video
My model of business is the Beatles, you know, there were four very talented guys who kept each other's negative tendencies in check. They balanced each other and their sum was greater than the parts. And that's how I see business. You know, great, great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by us. They're done by a team of people.

7:42  
Boom. All right, we're gonna take it to the classroom, I'm going to ask you to fill-in-the-blank. Great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by a team of people.
( add audience participation here) Now full transparency here. I don't claim to be as smart as Steve Jobs or as outrageous as a rockstar. But I can dress like one. 

See, I was born a poor Missouri farm kid. We call it a misery. And I was pretty much destined to be a farmer. A farmer with some pointy, impractical boots, a rhinestone belt buckle, and some pretty cool jackets. But nonetheless, I had a big unreasonable dream. And that dream was you know what?  Let's do a rock star rewind back to 1982 to find out.
(roll Mark Video)

In short: To be a rockstar. To live the rock and roll lifestyle. To let go of anything thats holding me back to pursue greatness.

The challenge was I wasn't a musician. I didn't sing. I lived out in the middle of nowhere and was flat broke. But I still had an undying passion for rock and roll music and knew it was destined to be a part of my life. As a result of this passion, I spent all my money buying as many records as I could. ( Maybe add for those of you born after 1989 a record is a piece of vinyl that you would put on a record player to listen to your music. ( maybe show a pic)
I was building an encyclopedia of rock and roll. Sadly knowledge doesnt always pay the bills. So I took this passion and looked at what skills I did have at the time.  I could bark like a dog. Do a pretty good siren and a heck of a  train whistle [do train whistle]  

So I did what any ambitious farm kid would do. I started a DJ company in high school and made moves to become a hit radio DJ.  I also bought a cow just in case the whole Radio thing didn't work out - kind of a farmer starter kit 101.  Hey, it was my backup cow! Give me a break.
