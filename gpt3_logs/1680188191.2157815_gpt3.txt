Improve this speech to have more structure and jokes from the fun quick witted speaker:

entertainment giant live nation's office. And instead of being like all the other wannabe rappers and asking how much money you got to pay me. Jay Z as we know him, asked the question How can we change the industry together? Have you ever thought about that question for your department, your teams, for your boss?, because I guarantee you, your executive leaders and your board of directors think about this all the time, Joan and her team thinks about this all the time. And I love what Joan has done for all of you and for the industry. So the next time I encourage you to get your team together or maybe when your boss gets the executive leaders together, you have to sit in and encourage him to drop this question. How can we change the industry together and then just sit back and zip it. Start writing down the answers? They'll give you gold.   And final question and probably my favorite, please welcome Lady Gaga.   29:03   Lady Gaga says, I wake up in the morning, I make my hair bow. I put on my katzie. And I call up everyone in the house of Gaga and say, How are we going to be brilliant today?  Its a simple practice that you can ask yourself and your team, because if we are going to be rock stars, we have set our daily goals so that they align with our big unreasonable dream.      ( picked up here) cut joan jett, Jay Z and gaga) So who's ready to get unreasonable?  30:35   So what is your name, miss?  30:41   Perfect, stand up. I want you to grab your drumsticks and lead

RESPONSE:

Entertainment giant Live Nation's office. Instead of asking, 'How much money do you got to pay me?', Jay Z asked the question, 'How can we change the industry together?' Have you ever thought about that question for your department, your teams, or even your boss? I'm sure that Joan and her team have! So the next time you get your team together or when your boss gets the executive leaders together, encourage them to drop this question and then just sit back and zip it. Start writing down the answers - they'll give you gold! And now for my favorite part - please welcome Lady Gaga! Lady Gaga says, 'I wake up in the morning, I make my hair bow. I put on my katzie and I call up everyone in the house of Gaga and say, How are we going to be brilliant today?' It's a simple practice that you can ask yourself and your team - if we're going to be rock stars, we have to set our daily goals so that they align with our big, unreasonable dream. So who's ready to get unreasonable? Now what is your name miss? Perfect, stand up! I want you to grab your drumsticks and lead us with a beat as we shout out our mission to make an impact in this industry! Let's go!
