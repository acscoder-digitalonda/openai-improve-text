See, I was born a poor Missouri farm kid. We call it a misery. And I was pretty much destined to be a farmer. A farmer with some pointy, impractical boots, a rhinestone belt buckle, and some pretty cool jackets. But nonetheless, I had a big unreasonable dream. And that dream was you know what?  Let's do a rock star rewind back to 1982 to find out. (roll Mark Video)  In short: To be a rockstar. To live the rock and roll lifestyle. To let go of anything thats holding me back to pursue greatness.  The challenge was I wasn't a musician. I didn't sing. I lived out in the middle of nowhere and was flat broke. But I still had an undying passion for rock and roll music and knew it was destined to be a part of my life. As a result of this passion, I spent all my money buying as many records as I could. ( Maybe add for those of you born after 1989 a record is a piece of vinyl that you would put on a record player to listen to your music. ( maybe show a pic) I was building an encyclopedia of rock and roll. Sadly knowledge doesnt always pay the bills. So I took this passion and looked at what skills I did have at the time.  I could bark like a dog. Do a pretty good siren and a heck of a  train whistle [do train whistle]    So I did what any ambitious farm kid would do. I started a DJ company in high school and made moves to become a hit radio DJ.  I also bought a cow just in case the whole Radio thing didn't work out - kind of a farmer starter kit 101.  Hey, it was my backup cow! Give
