RESPONSE:

Whoa, whoa, thank you! Put the drumsticks together, let's walk onto the stage and strike up a B chord. Can't hear you! Just like in a band, if you want to achieve your BUD and constantly be the ones driving the change, you have to surround yourself with the right kind of people and create the right kind of working relationships and culture so that everyone plays nicely together. And while that synergy may seem easy, it's really not. As leaders, you have to create that safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up, sharing ideas, and going for it without feeling like they need permission to get on stage. That's how you're going to keep your people engaged, solve great resignations, and make them feel like they have purpose and can change the industry together. Now I'll give you three key points to keep your band fine-tuned and operating at a higher level every day: 1. Put the band first. Legendary frontman Steven Tyler from Aerosmith said it best: "As good as I am, I am nothing without my band." Even with a big ego, he knows ya gotta do what's best for the team. 2. Honor everyone's unique abilities. In a band, some people are upfront and very noticeable like the lead singer (Mark does air guitar). But don't forget about those behind the scenes players too - they are just as important to creating that magical sound. 3. Let everyone jam! Give your team members creative freedom to express themselves and explore new ideas. This is how you get those amazing collaborations that make us all stand up and cheer! So let's get this party started - it's time to rock out with your team!
