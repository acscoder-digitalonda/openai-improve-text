Good evening everyone! I'm sure most of us here know that most people in our profession don't even go the first mile. But this is what confuses me. If we say we're going to do things to set ourselves apart, then doesn't it make sense that we should probably start doing things to set ourselves apart? (CUSTOMIZATION WITH REAL CLIENT EXAMPLES). So how can you be more like KISS? What is your spandex and makeup? What new, innovative and creative ideas can you come up with that will set you apart from the others? KISS isn't the only rock legend to set themselves apart by thinking big. Take Joan Jett for example. When Joan Jett started her band, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, she submitted her recordings to 23 record companies and was turned down 23 times. So what did she do? She started her own music label, Blackheart Records. She recorded the album and started selling it at concerts - something no one was doing back then. (Blackheart Records later branched out into hip hop, including signing Big Daddy Kane.) Later, MTV started and many artists feared it would kill the sales of records (people could watch/listen for free). But Joan Jett agreed to let them play her new song I Love Rock n Roll and it soared to the number one song in America, where it stayed for 6 weeks! Here's a fun fact you might not know: In 2005, another up and coming rapper walked off the streets of LA into a recording studio with a demo tape in hand. That rapper was none other than Kanye West! So if you ever feel discouraged, just remember that even the greats had to start somewhere.
