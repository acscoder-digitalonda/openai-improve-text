Congratulations You just nailed your first audition..  between you and me, how often have you fantasized about being a rock star? You don't have to answer out loud, but it's okay that you did. Because according to my unofficial research, over 72% of the most unlikely analytical ( industry professionals) do . See -  it doesn't matter what company you work for, or what  industry you're in.  The highest-level achievers are often referred to as the company.Rock Star Oh, come on, I realized this is the final day of the show. But i'm not feeling the love or the volume gotta TURN IT UP up, But just like HR, I believe everybody deserves a 59th second chance. So we're going to re-wind that statement and try it again. And this time to turn it up     There are millions of musicians, very few rock stars.  Rock Stars perform at a higher level. They have a bigger vision, they arent afraid of big goals and big dreams. As I look out at the crowd today I see a room full of rock stars. The question is      how do you stand out> How do you
