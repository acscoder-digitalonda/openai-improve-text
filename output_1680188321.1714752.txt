0:00 Person introducing Mark: Put your drumsticks together and get ready to welcome Marvellesss Mark! Let's get this party started. Ladies and gentleman find this beat Lets turn it up (Tap sticks along with music) Mark banters with the crowd as he walks through the audience heading to the stage.telling them to turn it up along the way. Will then divide the audience in half) Mark on stage music stops 1:31 Give yourselves a drumstick round of applause. Congratulations You just nailed your first audition.. between you and me, how often have you fantasized about being a rock star? You don't have to answer out loud, but I'm sure many of you are guilty of it! According to my unofficial research, over 72% of the most unlikely analytical ( industry professionals) do. So, it doesn't matter what company you work for or what industry you're in, the highest-level achievers are often referred to as the company's Rock Star. I know it's the final day of the show and I'm not feeling quite enough love or volume - so let's TURN IT UP! Just like HR, I believe everybody deserves a 59th second chance. There are millions of musicians, but very few rock stars. Rock Stars perform at a higher level. They have a bigger vision, they aren't afraid of big goals and big dreams. As I look out at this crowd today, I see a room full of rock stars - so how do you stand out? How do you make sure that you're not just another face in the crowd?

Remain relevant? How are you or your teams being heard above the noise? What you have to look forward to in the next few minutes is an action-packed, highly energized, and engaging show that will give you the instruments you need to achieve boldly in these challenging times - just like a rockstar. We're all performers, but we're not all rock stars. Rock Stars perform at a higher level every day and they think differently. I call it the Rockstar Mindset. Because if you think about it, your brain is a muscle too and if we don't use it, we do what? Lose it! Heaven forbid, we lose our brains in (City Name). So we're going to take the Rockstar Challenge. In just a moment you're going to see some familiar faces pop up on the screen. The nanosecond that you recognize someone I want you to shout their name out - louder than anybody else. So the less intelligent people know who you are! All eyes on the screen. On your mark, get set. Here we go! Starting with Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan and Mark Jones - congratulations, you get to advance to the lightning round a little bit faster and a little bit louder. Here we go! Starting with Aerosmith: Yes! You too! Now for the two-word double elimination triple point question: What two words would you use to describe all of these people on the screen? ROCKSTAR - because on one side of the screen we have the industry's best and brightest - and on the other side we have you - ready to show off your Rockstar Mindset! Let's do this!

Greetings, business rockstars! On one hand we have the music rockstars, and on the other, we have you - the business rockstars! But if you look closely, they all figured out how to make their businesses just as rockin' as their music. They, just like many of you, started out in an entry-level position or working out of their garage before they started selling out tours and arenas. But if you could call up any of these people on the screen today, with the exception of Elvis (because he's already rocking in the afterlife), they would tell you two reasons why they are up there: 1. They all had a big, unreasonable dream. 2. They committed to work together with their band or team to accomplish that dream no matter what. But don't worry - I'm not here to just talk about music rockstars! I'm here to talk about how YOU can use the same mindset to accomplish any big goal or dream. You know, like all those goals you've been working on for the next quarter and year? It's important that we as rock stars are constantly upgrading our mindset - just like how we upgrade our technology. We all rushed to get the new iPhone 14, so why wouldn't we constantly upgrade the way we think? Buy books, listen to podcasts, attend conferences like this - it's all part of upgrading your rockstar mindset. So let's get started! Ready to make your business rock?

Good evening everyone, I'm so glad to be here with you all tonight. Now, I'm sure you've all heard of Steve Jobs and his amazing business model. But do you know what it was? Well, let me give you a hint. It wasn't Thomas Edison, or Warren Buffett, Jack Welch or Oprah Winfrey. It was something a little more...rock star. That's right! His business model was the Beatles! Now, let me quote him directly: "My model of business is the Beatles, you know, there were four very talented guys who kept each other's negative tendencies in check. They balanced each other and their sum was greater than the parts. And that's how I see business. You know, great, great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by us. They're done by a team of people." So here's my challenge to you all: Can you fill in the blank? Great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by a team of people. ( Add audience participation here) Now I may not be as smart as Steve Jobs or as outrageous as a rockstar, but I can certainly dress like one! (Pause for laughter) So let's keep this mindset right now: Nobody wants to be stuck on Windows 95!

See, I was born a poor Missouri farm kid. We call it a misery. And I was pretty much destined to be a farmer. A farmer with some pointy, impractical boots, a rhinestone belt buckle, and some pretty cool jackets. But nonetheless, I had a big unreasonable dream. And that dream was to be a rock star. To live the rock and roll lifestyle. To let go of anything that's holding me back to pursue greatness. The challenge was I wasn't a musician. I didn't sing. I lived out in the middle of nowhere and was flat broke. But I still had an undying passion for rock and roll music and knew it was destined to be a part of my life. As a result of this passion, I spent all my money buying as many records as I could. (For those of you born after 1989, a record is a piece of vinyl that you would put on a record player to listen to your music - maybe show a pic.) I was building an encyclopedia of rock and roll! Sadly knowledge doesn't always pay the bills. So I took this passion and looked at what skills I did have at the time. I could bark like a dog. Do a pretty good siren and a heck of a train whistle [do train whistle] So I did what any ambitious farm kid would do: I started a DJ company in high school and made moves to become a hit radio DJ! I also bought a cow just in case the whole Radio thing didn't work out - kind of like a farmer starter kit 101! Hey, it was my backup cow! Give it up for the cow!

Good morning everybody! I bet you didn't expect to see a cow up here (look at the cow and moo). But I learned very early the power of leveraging relationships, upgrading my mindset, and working as a team. And my business began to grow - and so did a cow! As I was working in radio, my business grew even more and I had to make an executive decision to leverage what I had to take my career further. While this move to radio was living the dream, I started to see a pattern. Why do some rock stars make one-hit wonders and fade away while others go on to become legends, releasing hit after hit? All of these bands were good - good enough to make a hit heard across America. But only some of them went on to achieve greatness. This fascination led me to a lifelong study of Rock stars. I wanted to see if there was some sort of commonality to their success. It turns out that these legendary artists, on top of being amazing performers, also employed many of the same habits, tools, and strategies to get to and stay at the top. As I learned more about this, I started to see that everyday people working at companies could apply these rock and roll insights. So I started working with some of the biggest companies like Home Depot, IBM, and Delta, delivering these rockstar lessons while giving them an experience of the rock and roll lifestyle I love so much. And the passion just grew even further, taking this experience to 24 countries allowing me to work alongside some of the rock and roll heroes that I study and speak about. So if you want your career or business to go from zero-to-hero like a rock star - let's get rocking!

Traveling over three and a half million miles on Delta, hundreds of hours backstage with Rockstar CEOs and famous VIPs, this journey eventually led me to the publishing of my first book. In it, I breakdown what separates the good and the great rock and rollers, the business lessons we can learn, and how we can all unlock our inner rockstar in whatever we do in life. As I'm sure you've heard before - there is a rock star inside of everyone that is just waiting to get out. An inner version of yourself that is focused and aligned toward achieving big dreams. And that's what I'm going to talk to you about today: how you can become the best version of yourself, how to turn your life volume up to 11, and how to come together with your team members as a band set out to achieve greatness. Are you ready to turn it up? There are four chords or principles of Rockstar success that are used across the music and business world. If you can implement these rockstar principles into your daily life, you will open yourself up to a world of new possibilities. I know you've accomplished a lot to even be in this room - you are the best of the best - but __________ told me what you've got ahead and I'm 100% certain that what got you here won't get you there. So, let me ask again: Are you committed? Are you ready to turn it up? If so, let's get started!

Are you ready to get this party started? Hit me three times if you're ready! Today we are going to break some records, not vinyl records, but records that matter! Amazing! The cool thing about using these rockstar principles is, you don't have to stay up all night or trash your hotel room to do it. Of course, you can still drive your rental car like a maniac, depending on your expense account. Did you know that almost every popular song you hear on the radio, you stream or you download is made up of some variation of the exact same four chords? It's true, we're gonna check out a band called the Axis of Awesome where they're playing a bunch of popular tunes all sung over the exact same four chords. So grab your drumsticks, play along and let's see how many of these songs you recognize. Here we go! These four chords that you just heard are the building blocks or the foundation of becoming an ______Name the Profession/Industry______ Rockstar. And today I'm going to break down these four chords of Rockstar success into the A, B, C and D chords. But today, we're gonna do them backwards. Why? Because we're rockstars and we don't have to play by the rules! You know, as ________Name the Profession/Industry_________ and the teams that support you, you want more than just satisfied customers. You also want excited teammates and raving fans who will go out and spread the word about what you do. So let's get this party started - hit me three times if you're ready!

Welcome everyone! Are you ready to rock? If we're not excited, how can we expect to get everybody else excited? It all starts with each and every one of you here in this room. So I will say and the crowd goes wild, raise your jazz hands and scream: "Thank you!" Now grab your drumsticks and please welcome to the stage your D Chord - Hit me 3 times. 16:02 - Thank you, Steven Tyler for the Rockstar mating call! Dreams, goals, vision - We've all heard that we have to have them right? The cool thing about rock stars is that they have big, unreasonable dreams - they don't just want to get by, pay the bills, and have a nice retirement. They want to take over the universe and change the world! In Madonna's first appearance on American Bandstand with Dick Clark, he asked her: "Madonna, what do you hope will happen, not only in 1984 but for the rest of your professional life? What are your dreams? What's left?" Madonna answered simply: "To rule the world!" Big and unreasonable - you bet! Therefore, Rockstar success requires a big unreasonable dream. And I'm here to argue that your continued success is going to require a big unreasonable dream too. Why is a big dream so important? Because reasonable dreams often get lost in our day-to-day lives. They don't excite us enough to push through and make them real. That's why you need a Big Unreasonable Dream (I call this your B.U.D). These dreams fire us up, show us the way and keep us focused on the prize. So let's make our B.U.D's bigger than ever before and let's get ready to rock this world!

Welcome everyone, it's a pleasure to be here today. As we all know, the world is competitive now more than ever, and the pandemic has only made it more so. Average just isn't enough anymore. Average dreams come from average people and only produce average results. If you want to become a rock star at work and at home, you need to get crystal clear on your Big Unreasonable Dream (BUD). When you focus on the Dream, the work to get there all of sudden has a greater purpose. You become a rockstar on your way to accomplish your BUD, and this energy is infectious - it spreads to you, your boss, your team members, and everyone else in your band. So what is your BUD? Most of us have a personal BUD and a professional one, but I'm willing to guess that most of your buds are not big enough. You need to 10x them! When you 10x your Bud you start playing up here, that's when you set a new standard for yourself and for your company - the universe, your mind or as I believe God starts to transpire to make this happen for you. This is your new standard and you work backwards towards your goal. I had the privilege to speak with some of you. For example, I spoke with [Name} from [company or Dept], who told me their BUD was [example]. And then I spoke with [Name] from [company or Dept], whose BUD was [example]. Now THAT'S a BUD! So let's get going and make our Big Unreasonable Dreams come true!

Good morning everyone, speaking of Buds, does anyone remember these guys? (roll song and slide) How in the world did KISS get out of the garage and become rock legends? Like millions of other bands, they were just two guitars, bass and drums. But unlike the other bands that were waiting to be discovered, KISS had a BUD! Co-founder Gene Simmons said we want to create the greatest and most raucous band in the world. And they were willing to do what others were not. I want you to imagine the early 1970s. Gene and the boys are sitting on coolers in their garage and just got done rehearsing. And all of a sudden Gene jumps up and says "What can we do to make our band different?" It was probably one of those rare moments when someone raised their hand and said, "Hey Gene, we can put on makeup that makes us look like a cat and a demon." And we can all get a tongue implant. KISS wanted to set themselves apart so much that you couldn't help but remember them. Because they weren't just creating a band - they were creating a brand. They spent hours putting on makeup and elaborate costumes for every show and public appearance. This dedication to going above and beyond led them to build an empire behind this image. To date Kiss has generated over half a billion dollars from licensing alone - and with 20 inch heels! They weren't just music giants - they were business giants. So my question for all of you out there this morning is what are you willing to do that others are not? Show up early, stay late, go the extra mile. As KISS said - "You've got to lose your mind in Detroit Rock City!"

Good evening everyone! I'm sure most of us here know that most people in our profession don't even go the first mile. But this is what confuses me. If we say we're going to do things to set ourselves apart, then doesn't it make sense that we should probably start doing things to set ourselves apart? (CUSTOMIZATION WITH REAL CLIENT EXAMPLES). So how can you be more like KISS? What is your spandex and makeup? What new, innovative and creative ideas can you come up with that will set you apart from the others? KISS isn't the only rock legend to set themselves apart by thinking big. Take Joan Jett for example. When Joan Jett started her band, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, she submitted her recordings to 23 record companies and was turned down 23 times. So what did she do? She started her own music label, Blackheart Records. She recorded the album and started selling it at concerts - something no one was doing back then. (Blackheart Records later branched out into hip hop, including signing Big Daddy Kane.) Later, MTV started and many artists feared it would kill the sales of records (people could watch/listen for free). But Joan Jett agreed to let them play her new song I Love Rock n Roll and it soared to the number one song in America, where it stayed for 6 weeks! Here's a fun fact you might not know: In 2005, another up and coming rapper walked off the streets of LA into a recording studio with a demo tape in hand. That rapper was none other than Kanye West! So if you ever feel discouraged, just remember that even the greats had to start somewhere.

Entertainment giant Live Nation's office. Instead of asking, 'How much money do you got to pay me?', Jay Z asked the question, 'How can we change the industry together?' Have you ever thought about that question for your department, your teams, or even your boss? I'm sure that Joan and her team have! So the next time you get your team together or when your boss gets the executive leaders together, encourage them to drop this question and then just sit back and zip it. Start writing down the answers - they'll give you gold! And now for my favorite part - please welcome Lady Gaga! Lady Gaga says, 'I wake up in the morning, I make my hair bow. I put on my katzie and I call up everyone in the house of Gaga and say, How are we going to be brilliant today?' It's a simple practice that you can ask yourself and your team - if we're going to be rock stars, we have to set our daily goals so that they align with our big, unreasonable dream. So who's ready to get unreasonable? Now what is your name miss? Perfect, stand up! I want you to grab your drumsticks and lead us with a beat as we shout out our mission to make an impact in this industry! Let's go!

This room is about to rock! (We will rock you playing in the background) Boom, boom, pow, boom, boom, pow. I need three volunteers to come up on stage. Let's give our conductor a round of applause for a job well done! Alright, you three represent the decision makers in this room. You have already beaten out 5000 people who applied for this job and now you have 30 seconds to engage, energize, connect and build relationships to win as many votes as possible. Remember, this is a rock and roll show so there are no rules! Grab your drumsticks and let's play along to Sweet Child of Mine. As a reward for great behavior, I'm giving each of you a copy of my latest book Opportunity Rocks. Let's welcome our C Chord Rock Stars to the stage. Rock stars always drive change to achieve their big unreasonable dreams. Just look at the long-term successful rock stars like Elvis and how they evolved through the years!

Elvis may have changed his weight over the years, but he wasn't the only one to evolve. Take Madonna for example - she went from being like a virgin to expressing herself. Or Taylor Swift - she started as a cute country singer and now she's one of the most powerful women in the world! All she did was write a new album every time she broke up with her boyfriend and shake it off! But here's the important thing to remember about rock stars and evolution - it doesn't happen by accident. It takes intentional change to stay ahead of the curve and remain successful. Just look at companies like Blockbuster and Borders Books - they were unable to keep up with the changes in the industry and now they're in the graveyard. At the end of the day, if you want to stay on top, you need to recognize that what got you there won't get you to where you want to be. You need to get outside of your comfort zone, embrace change, find new fans, and connect with them. That's how you keep rockin' on!

Change is inevitable, and it's uncomfortable, but if you want to be a rock legend, you need to accept it. Now, changing intentionally can sometimes mean breaking a few rules - something rock stars do very well! For example, there was a time in the music industry when they were terrified of live bootleg recordings cutting into their profits. But one band took a different approach: they encouraged their fans to bring recording devices and even roped off a spot in front of the stage to get the best sound. And do you know what happened? It spread their music farther and wider and made them one of the most iconic bands in the world. It also created a bond with their fans so strong that it still exists today, even after the lead singer has passed away and the band has broken up. Who are they? (PAUSE FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT) That's right - The Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia! And because of that, it made the Grateful Dead the most successful touring act of all time. So your C chord (PAUSE FOR LAUGHTER) is to be the ones driving the change. And to do that, that's going to mean changing intentionally on a regular basis. You have to be the only one who does what you do - how can you create that kind of bond with your fans, with your customers? Alright, jazz hands ready (PAUSE FOR LAUGHTER) and let's hear it for change!

Whoa, whoa, thank you! Put the drumsticks together, let's walk onto the stage and strike up a B chord. Can't hear you! Just like in a band, if you want to achieve your BUD and constantly be the ones driving the change, you have to surround yourself with the right kind of people and create the right kind of working relationships and culture so that everyone plays nicely together. And while that synergy may seem easy, it's really not. As leaders, you have to create that safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up, sharing ideas, and going for it without feeling like they need permission to get on stage. That's how you're going to keep your people engaged, solve great resignations, and make them feel like they have purpose and can change the industry together. Now I'll give you three key points to keep your band fine-tuned and operating at a higher level every day: 1. Put the band first. Legendary frontman Steven Tyler from Aerosmith said it best: "As good as I am, I am nothing without my band." Even with a big ego, he knows ya gotta do what's best for the team. 2. Honor everyone's unique abilities. In a band, some people are upfront and very noticeable like the lead singer (Mark does air guitar). But don't forget about those behind the scenes players too - they are just as important to creating that magical sound. 3. Let everyone jam! Give your team members creative freedom to express themselves and explore new ideas. This is how you get those amazing collaborations that make us all stand up and cheer! So let's get this party started - it's time to rock out with your team!

Good morning everyone! I'm sure you all know who Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones is, but do you know who Bill Wyman is? (Raise your left drumstick if you know who Bill Wyman is). Alright, five people know who he is. Well, Bill Wyman was the original bass player for the Rolling Stones and in interviews with Jagger about the stones, he goes on and on about what a great bass player Bill Wyman is. And that's why the stones are still together. Even though their tour bus goes 30 miles an hour in the left lane down the freeway with the blinker on, they're still together. The same is true for us. We have to allow each person to play out his or her part and then honor that person for their contribution. It's been said about the Rolling Stones that Mick Jagger makes them famous and Keith Richards makes them a band. Some of us make our bands famous, (audience bit) while others like the bass player, barely get noticed at all. But a smart Rockstar makes sure that everyone in the band gets honored. So my question to you all is, who are your bass players? When was the last time you thanked them? Gave them a gift card? A pat on the back? So let's give a shout out to some of our bass players, (recognize av and ...). Let's make sure they know how much we appreciate their contribution!

Welcome everyone! Some bands like U2 become legendary, but most bands break up. What is it that almost always breaks them up? Ego, except when it's Yoko! What keeps a band together is humility. A band leader who isn't overcome with their ego and knows that the band is better together. Okay, let's do this! We're on The Final Countdown so everybody come with me (audience hums Final Countdown). 50:31 and welcome to the stage your A Chord! 50:46 Okay, maybe not that kind of action. Here's the deal - you can have the biggest bud in the world, you can see the change you have to drive, you can have the most awesome band members. But without action, none of that means anything. Taking daily massive action is the only thing that will take you to your bud. Whenever I plan my day or week, I get out an old school legal pad - I call it a legal pad AI - but you can do this on your computer or mobile device. I draw a line down the middle and on one side I put a top 10 list and on the other side I put my top three. Then I write down everything I want to accomplish that day or week. Only things in my top 10 list that are directly connected to my A Chord get into the top three list. And if I have more than three, then its audition time - pick out the most important three!

And then you do those first. Now I have a shortcut or a hack. When I'm doing my audition and I'm going down that top 10 list. I look at each line item. And I say to myself if it's not a Hell yeah, or a rock on, then it's a no. And it doesn't get in the Top three list. Sometimes people ask, Mark, why only three? Well, Jim Collins did the research for you and the scientific data is there - and I'd be happy to share it with you later on - but he says if you have more than three priorities, you don't have any; your bandwidth is too thin. You're busy and not productive. But I love this quote from Gary Keller: "If you could get only one thing done today, and it made all of your other tasks unnecessary, what would it be? Then do that now." Just give it 60 days and try this principle. If you do that, you will find that a lot of the top 10 list will automatically go away, or you won't need to do them. Is taking daily massive action going to be easy? Of course not! It wouldn't be any fun if it was easy. (Bill Bachrack says if comfort is your goal success is not in your future - and since we are talking rock n roll here is their version of the phrase: "Highway to hell slide!") So take the road less traveled, take the stairway - because taking daily massive action isn't easy, but trust me it is much better than fear, failure or mediocrity. Now what you see up on the screen is going to help you remember what you've already begun to forget: if you're ready for the journey of a lifetime, let's get started!

Next steps, and you're ready to fulfill your BUD...I've got everything you need to start your journey in a playbook. Because who wants a work book right? the QR code..." will take you to this free download It has all todays notes quote and slides, plus a lot of bonus material, book recommendations and CTAs it makes a great training manual with or without my book if you want to incorporate The Rock Star Mindset training into your daily routines. Because I would love to have you on board, I would love to connect with you and your people. And those of you that took pictures today, just like you get evaluations, I asked you honestly to please evaluate me, go on my social media and post a photo or a comment, things you like didn't like be raw, be real, because that's how I get better. I need your feedback. Also, if you need like a little dose of Roctane on my Facebook and Instagram, I have daily Rockstar Motivation Quotes and Roctane quotes to help jumpstart your day. Now it's time to become the rock stars of your industry! It's the perfect formula for a hit song: four chords, take action right now and make some noise! Stand up. Grab your drumsticks start pounding on the table Chanting We want show. We want show. We want show. We want show. Can you hear me now? Louder! Louder! Faster, faster, faster. Okay, okay. Okay, thank you! (mark takes a bow) Now go out there and be the rock stars that stand out in an overcrowded industry and heard above the noise! Thank you!

Hey everyone! I'm sure you're wondering why I'm handing out drumsticks. That's because I want to anchor in my message and create an engaging and fun atmosphere. So, I want you all to take your drumsticks back to your offices or wherever you work and when you're having a bad day, pop in your air buds, play your favorite anthem and have some fun. Beat on your desks and refocus on what we talked about today. Think of the different metaphors we can come up with; let's drum up some business, beat the competition and our company wants to the beat of a different drum. And that's why I thought it would be fun to introduce the first ever All Star Band starring all of you! We'll have drummers, lead singers, a rhythm section and bass players. The first two rows of tables right over here will be our drummers. So let's get ready for a rockin' show!

Good evening everyone! I'm here to talk about drummers and bass players, and their importance in the world of business. Drummers are the leadership in their respective bands, providing the beat, tone, and foundation for everyone else to follow. As a CEO, President, Executive Leader, or VP of Operations, you could be considered the drummer in your organization. So let's try it out! Put your sticks in both hands and pound on the table on a one and a three. Let's go 5-6-7-8-1-and-3, hit them hard! Now for our unsung heroes of the room - the bass players! A song would be pretty dull without a good thumping baseline. So think of your unsung heroes - Facilities, Accounting, Delivery Teams, EA's, Shipping & Receiving, Mailroom Vendors, Trainers, Third Party People - they are all your bass players. Hold your stick in the left hand halfway up and strike with your right hand on two and four - two and four - don't forget to smile when you do it! So don't forget folks - drummers provide the beat and bass players provide the thumping baseline that we all need to keep us going. Now let's put it all together and make some music!

People often wonder what we've been up to, and I'm here to tell you that it has been nothing short of amazing. That's performance. Alright, hold that thought bass players! Let's talk about the rhythm section - when the song starts to take notice or you start to recognize the melody. It's like the rhythm section is working double time, so who are some of your rhythm people? Think of marketing, PR, HR, project managers, admins, meeting planners - if your company does a lot of events. And I must say, I'd love to meet your meeting planner! Okay, now let's get down to it - rhythm section, double time! 1234567812345678 Don't forget to smile! Alright, great job. Last but certainly not least are our lead singers - Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Madonna, Mick Jagger or Steven Tyler - they're walking the walk and talking the talk. They have a message to convey and they need a strong band around them to help convey it. So think about sales directors, business development and customer service if you have customers. If you do a great job and your company has a superior product then you can be sure that your customers will be satisfied.

I'm sure you all know that your customers are the lead singers, they'll be the ones telling everyone how great you are. So I want you to come in on the count of five, hit the table three times, and shout "Rock!" 5-6-7-8-1-2-3-4-5-6 EAA Rock! 1-2-3-4-5-6. Great job! Now, I know you could be holding back, but you're going to need to shout it out if you want to be heard over all the noise. So I'm going to bring you in one section at a time and I've chosen a really appropriate song for today's messaging - Yes And Admins Rock. It's from David Bowie and it's called "Rebel Rebel". If you look up 'Rebel' in the Urban Dictionary, it says a person doesn't follow the crowd and doesn't accept normal behavior - and if we're going to drive change, if we're going to take daily massive action on important but not urgent tasks, then we have to be those rebels. We have to do things differently. So standby, I'm going to bring you in one table at a time and you're going to love this version of Rebel Rebel - it was done in 2016 in Italy with 1000 musicians playing the same song at the same time - it was loud! Alright, standby!
