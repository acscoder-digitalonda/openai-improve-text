Improve this speech to have more structure and jokes from the fun quick witted speaker:

Elvis totally evolved through the years and I'm not just talking about his weight. Thank you very much. Can I have a hot dog please? How about Madonna? Madonna was and is constantly reinventing herself. She went from being like a virgin touched for the very first time to expressing herself. Or how about Taylor Swift, who started out as a cute country singer, and now named by Forbes Magazine as one of the 50 most powerful women in the world. And all she did was write a new album every time she broke up with her boyfriend. And shake it off. But here's the one and most important thing that most people miss about rock stars and how they change. They change intentionally. It doesn't happen by accident, and for you to drive change that's going to be purposefully reinvented on a regular basis, orchestrated evolution.   Because what happens when you don't change intentionally? You end up like one of these greats in the graveyard. You end up like a blockbuster saying.. We're not blockbuster. We're blockheads. Why didn't we think of putting red boxes in front of stores? Or Borders books going online book sales? What a concept. Why didn't we think of that? We could have been Amazon. And why are these and many greats in the graveyard? Because they refuse to recognize what got them here wont get them to their BUD.  They refused to evolve, go out and find new fans and, and customers to connect, listen and play  their music.  They refused to get outside of their comfort zone and embrace

RESPONSE:

Elvis may have changed his weight over the years, but he wasn't the only one to evolve. Take Madonna for example - she went from being like a virgin to expressing herself. Or Taylor Swift - she started as a cute country singer and now she's one of the most powerful women in the world! All she did was write a new album every time she broke up with her boyfriend and shake it off! But here's the important thing to remember about rock stars and evolution - it doesn't happen by accident. It takes intentional change to stay ahead of the curve and remain successful. Just look at companies like Blockbuster and Borders Books - they were unable to keep up with the changes in the industry and now they're in the graveyard. At the end of the day, if you want to stay on top, you need to recognize that what got you there won't get you to where you want to be. You need to get outside of your comfort zone, embrace change, find new fans, and connect with them. That's how you keep rockin' on!
