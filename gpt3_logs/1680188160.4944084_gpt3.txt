push you to the next level and open a new world of possibility and success.  In today's competitive environment, especially coming out of the pandemic,Average is no longer enough. Average dreams come from average people and only produce average results. Average means you may soon be out of a job or out of business.  If you want to become a rock star at work and at home, you need to get crystal clear on your Big Unreasonable Dream. Because when you focus on the Dream, the work to get there all of sudden has a greater purpose. You are a rockstar on your way to accomplish your BUD. You come in fired up because you are working on your BUD. This energy is infectious. To you,Your boss and your team members and everyone else in your band. It's contagious , you have to spread it. So what is your bud? Your big unreasonable dream, most of us have a personal BUDAnd we'll have a professional  BUD but I'm willing to guess that most of your buds are not big enough, you need to 10x them. Because when you 10x your Bud  you start playing up here, that's when you set a new standard for yourself and for your company, and the universe, your mind or as I believe God starts to transpire to make this happen for you. This is your new standard and you work backwards towards your goal.    I had the privilege to speak with some of you. I spoke with [Name} from [company or Dept]. I asked her what her BUD was. (customization) usually two or three examples.) And then I spoke with . Thats a BUD Now

RESPONSE:

Welcome everyone, it's a pleasure to be here today. As we all know, the world is competitive now more than ever, and the pandemic has only made it more so. Average just isn't enough anymore. Average dreams come from average people and only produce average results. If you want to become a rock star at work and at home, you need to get crystal clear on your Big Unreasonable Dream (BUD). When you focus on the Dream, the work to get there all of sudden has a greater purpose. You become a rockstar on your way to accomplish your BUD, and this energy is infectious - it spreads to you, your boss, your team members, and everyone else in your band. So what is your BUD? Most of us have a personal BUD and a professional one, but I'm willing to guess that most of your buds are not big enough. You need to 10x them! When you 10x your Bud you start playing up here, that's when you set a new standard for yourself and for your company - the universe, your mind or as I believe God starts to transpire to make this happen for you. This is your new standard and you work backwards towards your goal. I had the privilege to speak with some of you. For example, I spoke with [Name} from [company or Dept], who told me their BUD was [example]. And then I spoke with [Name] from [company or Dept], whose BUD was [example]. Now THAT'S a BUD! So let's get going and make our Big Unreasonable Dreams come true!
