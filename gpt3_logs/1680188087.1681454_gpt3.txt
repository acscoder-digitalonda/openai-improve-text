business rockstars. And on the other, we have the music rockstars. But they all figured out how to make their businesses rock.    They, like many of you, started out at an entry-level position or in the garage before they started selling out tours and arenas. But if you could call up any of these people on the screen today, with the exception of Elvis, they would tell you,   There are 2 reasons they are up there, 1. They all had a big unreasonable dream. 2. They committed to work together with their band or team (yes every rock star has a team) to accomplish that dream no matter what.    So Thats great Mark, but what does that have to do with me? Well theres something else that I didnt tell you.

RESPONSE:

Greetings, business rockstars! On one hand we have the music rockstars, and on the other, we have you - the business rockstars! But if you look closely, they all figured out how to make their businesses just as rockin' as their music. They, just like many of you, started out in an entry-level position or working out of their garage before they started selling out tours and arenas. But if you could call up any of these people on the screen today, with the exception of Elvis (because he's already rocking in the afterlife), they would tell you two reasons why they are up there: 1. They all had a big, unreasonable dream. 2. They committed to work together with their band or team to accomplish that dream no matter what. But don't worry - I'm not here to just talk about music rockstars! I'm here to talk about how YOU can use the same mindset to accomplish any big goal or dream. You know, like all those goals you've been working on for the next quarter and year? It's important that we as rock stars are constantly upgrading our mindset - just like how we upgrade our technology. We all rushed to get the new iPhone 14, so why wouldn't we constantly upgrade the way we think? Buy books, listen to podcasts, attend conferences like this - it's all part of upgrading your rockstar mindset. So let's get started! Ready to make your business rock?
