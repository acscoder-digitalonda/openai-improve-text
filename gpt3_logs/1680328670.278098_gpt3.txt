hold that beat in your mind. Now on this side of the room. We have the bass players are unsung heroes. Yes. You know, song would be pretty lame without a good thumping baseline. You know, we said the bass players are not always upfront and seen. But we got to have bass in our song, right? It's all about the bass. So your unsung heroes in your world could be it. Facilities, accounting, delivery teams, EA sometimes shipping receiving the mailroom vendors, trainers, third party people like that. Those are your bass player. And I'm sure you can probably think of a few more. So bass players, I want you to hold your stick and the left hand about halfway up. You're going to strike with your right on a two and a four. It's going to be two and four and two, and four. Don't forget to smile when you smile for no reason. People wonder what you've been up to. All right, great job. This is what we live for. That's performance. All right, hold that thought bass players. This section right here. You're going to be the rhythm section. All right. Good. Okay. I owe you a steak dinner. Okay, rhythm section, that's when the song starts to take notice or you start to recognize the melody. And I say it starts to get some pillars and legs but it can't quite walk on its own. A lot of times the rhythm section people they're working double time. So who are some of your rhythm people? Maybe it's marketing PR HR project managers admins meeting planners if your company has you know a lot of events and things like that. Which by the way, I would like to meet your meeting planner. Okay rhythm section because you're going double time, but your sticks up in the air and we're gonna go double time like this 1234567812345678 Don't forget smile.. All right, great job. Last but certainly not last. Everybody else that has left. You're our lead singers are Beyonce or Taylor Swift's or Madonna's or Mick Jagger's or Steven Tyler's walking the walk talking to dogs Scream and accompany message only because you're supported and surrounded by an amazing, awesome band. So lead singers, anything to do with sales, maybe directors business development. And depending on how your business or your company is, if you have customers, if you do a great job, your company does a great job, you have a superior product, great customer service, your customers are going to be your lead singers, they're going to tell everybody how awesome you are. So lead singers, you're going to come in on a six count. Hit the table three times really, really fast. And say. rock. All right, so I'll count you in 567-812-3456 EAS rock 123456123456 All right, great job. Now here's the deal. I know you're holding back because there's gonna be a lot of noise here in about 30 seconds. So EAA rockers, lead singers, you're going to have to shout it out if you're going to be heard above the noise. Okay, now I'm going to bring you in one section at a time. And you're gonna love the song that I chose today, because I thought it was really appropriate with all the messaging and the Yes, and admins rock. So it's from the late grade David boy. And it's called Rebel rebel. Because if you look up rebel in the urban dictionary, this is what it says. A person who doesn't follow the crowd go through everyday motions and does not accept normal behavior. if we're going to drive change, if we're going to have the most awesome band members and take daily massive action on important and not urgent, we got to be the rebels. We got to do things differently. So standby, I'm going to bring you in one table at a time. You're gonna love this version. It was done in 2016. In Italy in a stadium where they did the impossible they brought 1000 musicians together all playing the same song at the same time and playing it loud. Alright.
