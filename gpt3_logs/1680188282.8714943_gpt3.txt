Hey everyone! I'm sure you're wondering why I'm handing out drumsticks. That's because I want to anchor in my message and create an engaging and fun atmosphere. So, I want you all to take your drumsticks back to your offices or wherever you work and when you're having a bad day, pop in your air buds, play your favorite anthem and have some fun. Beat on your desks and refocus on what we talked about today. Think of the different metaphors we can come up with; let's drum up some business, beat the competition and our company wants to the beat of a different drum.
