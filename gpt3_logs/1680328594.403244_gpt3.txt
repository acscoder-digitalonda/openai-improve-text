Like millions of other bands, they were just two guitars, bass and drums. But unlike the other bands that were waiting to be discovered, KISS had a BUD 
Co founder Gene Simmons said we want to create the greatest and most raucous band in the world. And they were willing to do what others were not. I want you to imagine the early 1970s Gene and the boys are sitting on coolers in their garage and just got done rehearsing. And all of a sudden Gene jumps up and says What can we do to make our band different? See, I wonder who it was that raised their hand and said, Hey Gene, we can put on makeup that makes us look like a cat and a demon. ... And we can all get a tongue implant. Kiss wanted to set themselves apart, so much that you couldnt help but remember them.  Because they weren't just creating a band. They were creating a brand. They spent hours putting on makeup and elaborate costumes for every show and public appearance. This dedication to going above and beyond led them to build an empire behind this image. To date Kiss has generated over half a billion dollars from licensing alone. 

And with 20 inch heels. They weren't just music giants. They were business giants. So my question for all of you out there this morning is what are you willing to do that others are not? Show up early,stay late, go the extra mile. As I'm sure most of you know, most people in your profession don't even go the first mile. But this is what confuses me. If we say we're going to do things to set ourselves apart, then doesn't it make sense that we should probably start doing things to set ourselves apart.
(CUSTOMIZATION WITH REAL CLIENT EXAMPLES.). 


So how can you be more like kiss? What is your spandex and makeup? What new, innovative and creative ideas can you come up with that will set you apart, apart from the others.=  

26:17  ( had to cut for First citizens to make time)
Kiss isnt the only rock legend to set themselves apart by thinking big. 
ADDING JOAN JETT
When Joan Jett started her band, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts submitted their recordings to 23 record companies. She was turned down 23 times. What did she do? She started her own music label, Blackheart Records (. She recorded the album (spending her own money to record songs like I Love Rock n Roll), and started selling it at concerts  which no one was doing back then. (Blackheart Records later branched out into hip hop, including signing Big Daddy Kane.)
Later, MTV started and many artists feared it would kill the sales of records. (People can watch/listen to for free.) But Joan Jett agreed to let them play her new song I Love Rock n Roll and it soared to the number one song in America, where it stayed for 6 weeks.


Here is some trivia you might not know: The year was 2005, another up and coming rapper walked off the streets of LA into entertainment giant live nation's office. And instead of being like all the other wannabe rappers and asking how much money you got to pay me. Jay Z as we know him, asked the question How can we change the industry together? Have you ever thought about that question for your department, your teams, for your boss?, because I guarantee you, your executive leaders and your board of directors think about this all the time, Joan and her team thinks about this all the time. And I love what Joan has done for all of you and for the industry. So the next time I encourage you to get your team together or maybe when your boss gets the executive leaders together, you have to sit in and encourage him to drop this question. How can we change the industry together and then just sit back and zip it. Start writing down the answers? They'll give you gold. 

And final question and probably my favorite, please welcome Lady Gaga.


29:03  
Lady Gaga says, I wake up in the morning, I make my hair bow. I put on my katzie. And I call up everyone in the house of Gaga and say, How are we going to be brilliant today?  Its a simple practice that you can ask yourself and your team, because if we are going to be rock stars, we have set our daily goals so that they align with our big unreasonable dream. 




( picked up here) cut joan jett, Jay Z and gaga)
So who's ready to get unreasonable?

30:35  
So what is your name, miss?

30:41  
Perfect, stand up. I want you to grab your drumsticks and lead this room.

(we will rock you playing in the background)
 And

30:47  
boom, boom, pow, boom, boom, pow. And while she's doing that, and this is first come first serve, I need three volunteers to the stage. There's three people on the stage. There's one. There's two there's three. 

All right, give our   conductor, a drumstick round of applause, great job.. So kudos to all of you. Now, here's the deal. You three represent... And these people in the audience  are all of the decision makers .  they've narrowed it down to you four. So you've already beat out 5000 people that applied for this job. Now you have to take it to the next level, you have 30 seconds to engage, energize, connect and build relationships to win as many votes as possible. Now I will say this, this is a rock and roll show. And as we all know, and rock and roll, there's not a lot of rules. So I'm not really saying what you can do or what you cannot do. ou are going to be raving fans. Grab your drumsticks play along and 321 go
(roll sweet child of mine)

So because we reward great behavior, ladies. I'm going to give you a copy of my latest book Opportunity Rocks. I'll be in the back of the room with books. So you come back and grab one say hey
35:06  
And everybody else please welcome to the stage your C Chord 

35:36  
Rock stars always drive change to achieve their bud.their big unreasonable dream. I mean, you look at the long term successful rock stars and how they evolved through the years like Elvis. Elvis totally evolved through the years and I'm not just talking about his weight. Thank you very much. Can I have a hot dog please? How about Madonna? Madonna was and is constantly reinventing herself. She went from being like a virgin touched for the very first time to expressing herself. Or how about Taylor Swift, who started out as a cute country singer, and now named by Forbes Magazine as one of the 50 most powerful women in the world. And all she did was write a new album every time she broke up with her boyfriend. And shake it off. But here's the one and most important thing that most people miss about rock stars and how they change. They change intentionally. It doesn't happen by accident, and for you to drive change that's going to be purposefully reinvented on a regular basis, orchestrated evolution.

RESPONSE:

Like millions of other bands, they were just two guitars, bass and drums. But unlike the other bands that were waiting to be discovered, KISS had a BUD - Big Unreasonable Dream. Co-founder Gene Simmons said, “We want to create the greatest and most raucous band in the world.” And they were willing to do what others were not; imagine the early 1970s with Gene and the boys sitting on coolers in their garage and then Gene jumps up and says, “What can we do to make our band different?” Who was it that raised their hand and said, “Hey Gene, we can put on makeup that makes us look like a cat and a demon. And we can all get a tongue implant.”? Kiss wanted to set themselves apart so much that you couldn’t help but remember them – because they weren’t just creating a band, they were creating a brand. They spent hours putting on makeup and elaborate costumes for every show and public appearance – this dedication to going above and beyond led them to build an empire behind this image. To date Kiss has generated over half a billion dollars from licensing alone – and with 20 inch heels! They weren’t just music giants; they were business giants. So my question for all of you out there this morning is: What are you willing to do that others are not? Show up early, stay late, go the extra mile. As I'm sure most of you know, most people in your profession don't even go the first mile. But this is what confuses me – if we say we’re going to do things to set ourselves apart, then doesn’t it make sense that we should actually start doing things to set ourselves apart? So how can you be more like Kiss? What is your spandex and makeup? What new, innovative and creative ideas can you come up with that will set you apart from the others? Kiss isn’t the only rock legend to set themselves apart by thinking big. When Joan Jett started her band, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts submitted their recordings to 23 record companies - she was turned down 23 times! What did she do? She started her own music label Blackheart Records, recorded the album spending her own money to record songs like I Love Rock n Roll - and started selling it at concerts which no one was doing back then! Blackheart Records later branched out into hip hop signing Big Daddy Kane.

And who could forget Lady Gaga who says “I wake up in the morning I make my hair bow. I put on my katzie (whatever that is) call up everyone in the house of Gaga and say ‘How are we going to be brilliant today?' It's a simple practice that you can ask yourself and your team because if we are going to be rock stars we have set our daily goals so that they align with our big unreasonable dream. So who's ready to get unreasonable? (waits for response) Perfect! Stand up grab your drumsticks (plays Sweet Child Of Mine in background) Give our conductor a drumstick round of applause - great job! Now here's the deal – you three represent all of us here today (looking at audience) You've already beat out 5000 people that applied for this job so now you have 30 seconds to engage energize connect and build relationships with as many votes as possible (crowd cheers) And because we reward great behaviour ladies - I'm going to give you a copy of my latest book Opportunity Rocks - grab one from me afterwards at the back of the room! So let's welcome your Chord Rockstars! (crowd cheers) Rock stars always drive change to achieve their Big Unreasonable Dreams. Look at Elvis who totally evolved through his career; not just his weight! Or Madonna who was constantly reinventing herself; from being like a virgin touched for the very first time to expressing herself. Taylor Swift started out as a cute country singer but named by Forbes Magazine as one of the 50 most powerful women in the world - all she did was write a new album every time she broke up with her boyfriend! So take inspiration from these Rockstars - intentionally drive change by orchestrating evolution! And when everyone else is asking how much money can I get paid - ask yourself how can I change this industry together? So grab those drumsticks let's have some fun - 321 GO!
