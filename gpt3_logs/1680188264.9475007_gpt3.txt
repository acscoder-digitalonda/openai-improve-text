And then you do those first. Now I have a shortcut or a hack. When I'm doing my audition and I'm going down that top 10 list. I look at each line item. And I say to myself if it's not a Hell yeah, or a rock on, then it's a no. And it doesn't get in the Top three list. Sometimes people ask, Mark, why only three? Well, Jim Collins did the research for you and the scientific data is there - and I'd be happy to share it with you later on - but he says if you have more than three priorities, you don't have any; your bandwidth is too thin. You're busy and not productive. But I love this quote from Gary Keller: "If you could get only one thing done today, and it made all of your other tasks unnecessary, what would it be? Then do that now." Just give it 60 days and try this principle. If you do that, you will find that a lot of the top 10 list will automatically go away, or you won't need to do them. Is taking daily massive action going to be easy? Of course not! It wouldn't be any fun if it was easy. (Bill Bachrack says if comfort is your goal success is not in your future - and since we are talking rock n roll here is their version of the phrase: "Highway to hell slide!") So take the road less traveled, take the stairway - because taking daily massive action isn't easy, but trust me it is much better than fear, failure or mediocrity. Now what you see up on the screen is going to help you remember what you've already begun to forget: if you're ready for the journey of a lifetime, let's get started!
