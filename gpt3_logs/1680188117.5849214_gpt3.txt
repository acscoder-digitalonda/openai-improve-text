Good morning everybody! I bet you didn't expect to see a cow up here (look at the cow and moo). But I learned very early the power of leveraging relationships, upgrading my mindset, and working as a team. And my business began to grow - and so did a cow! As I was working in radio, my business grew even more and I had to make an executive decision to leverage what I had to take my career further. While this move to radio was living the dream, I started to see a pattern. Why do some rock stars make one-hit wonders and fade away while others go on to become legends, releasing hit after hit? All of these bands were good - good enough to make a hit heard across America. But only some of them went on to achieve greatness. This fascination led me to a lifelong study of Rock stars.

And the passion just grew even further, taking this experience to 24 countries allowing me to work alongside some of the rock and roll heroes that I study and speak about. So if you want your career or business to go from zero-to-hero like a rock star - let's get rocking!
