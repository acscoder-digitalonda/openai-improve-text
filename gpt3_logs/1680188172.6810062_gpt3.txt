RESPONSE:

Good morning everyone, speaking of Buds, does anyone remember these guys? (roll song and slide) How in the world did KISS get out of the garage and become rock legends? Like millions of other bands, they were just two guitars, bass and drums. But unlike the other bands that were waiting to be discovered, KISS had a BUD! Co-founder Gene Simmons said we want to create the greatest and most raucous band in the world. And they were willing to do what others were not. I want you to imagine the early 1970s. Gene and the boys are sitting on coolers in their garage and just got done rehearsing. And all of a sudden Gene jumps up and says "What can we do to make our band different?" It was probably one of those rare moments when someone raised their hand and said, "Hey Gene, we can put on makeup that makes us look like a cat and a demon." And we can all get a tongue implant. KISS wanted to set themselves apart so much that you couldn't help but remember them. Because they weren't just creating a band - they were creating a brand. They spent hours putting on makeup and elaborate costumes for every show and public appearance. This dedication to going above and beyond led them to build an empire behind this image. To date Kiss has generated over half a billion dollars from licensing alone - and with 20 inch heels! They weren't just music giants - they were business giants. So my question for all of you out there this morning is what are you willing to do that others are not? Show up early, stay late, go the extra mile. As KISS said - "You've got to lose your mind in Detroit Rock City!"
