crew)  Some bands like U2, they go on and become legendary. But other bands, actually most bands, break up. And what is it class that almost always breaks up bands? EGO  Who said Yoko. Really? Okay, it's ego except when it's Yoko. But what keeps a band together is humility. A band leader that isn't overcome with the ego and knows that the band is better together. Okay, we're on The Final Countdown so everybody come with me Final Countdown here we go ( audience hums final countdown)  50:31   and welcome to the stage your a chord  .  50:46   Okay, maybe not that kind of action. Here's the deal, you can have the biggest bud in the world, you can see the change that you have to drive, you can have the most awesome band members. But none of that means anything without your a chord. And A stands for what class?  Action taking daily massive action is the only thing that will take you to your bud. So Whenever I plan my day or my week,, I'll get out an old school legal pad, I call it a legal pad AI  but you can do this on your computer or mobile device. And I draw a line right down to the middle. On one side I put a top 10 list. On the other side, I put my Top three. And then I write down everything that I want to accomplish for that day or for that week. Then I have an audition and only the things in my top 10 list that are directly connected to my D chord, my bud, get into the top three list. And if I have more than three, then I audition them and pick out the most important three.

RESPONSE:

Welcome everyone! Some bands like U2 become legendary, but most bands break up. What is it that almost always breaks them up? Ego, except when it's Yoko! What keeps a band together is humility. A band leader who isn't overcome with their ego and knows that the band is better together. Okay, let's do this! We're on The Final Countdown so everybody come with me (audience hums Final Countdown). 50:31 and welcome to the stage your A Chord! 50:46 Okay, maybe not that kind of action. Here's the deal - you can have the biggest bud in the world, you can see the change you have to drive, you can have the most awesome band members. But without action, none of that means anything. Taking daily massive action is the only thing that will take you to your bud. Whenever I plan my day or week, I get out an old school legal pad - I call it a legal pad AI - but you can do this on your computer or mobile device. I draw a line down the middle and on one side I put a top 10 list and on the other side I put my top three. Then I write down everything I want to accomplish that day or week. Only things in my top 10 list that are directly connected to my A Chord get into the top three list. And if I have more than three, then its audition time - pick out the most important three!
