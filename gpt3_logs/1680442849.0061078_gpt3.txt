Because what happens when you don't change intentionally? You end up like one of these greats in the graveyard. You end up like a blockbuster saying.. We're not blockbuster. We're blockheads. Why didn't we think of putting red boxes in front of stores? Or Borders books going online book sales? What a concept. Why didn't we think of that? We could have been Amazon. And why are these and many greats in the graveyard? Because they refuse to recognize what got them here wont get them to their BUD.  They refused to evolve, go out and find new fans and, and customers to connect, listen and play  their music.  They refused to get outside of their comfort zone and embrace change. Change is inevitable, its uncomfortable, but if you are going to stand the test of time and become a rock legend, you need to accept that you are going to have to accept change.Now, changing intentionally can sometimes mean that we have to break a few rules, which rock stars do very well. But most of us don't. Here's what I mean, there was a time in the music industry when they were terrified about live bootleg recordings cutting into their profits,  but this band actually encouraged their fans to bring recording devices. They even roped off a spot right in front of the stage to give them the best sound in the house. And what did it do? It spread their music farther and wider and made them one of the most iconic bands in the world. It also created a bond with their fans. A bond so strong that it still exists to this day, even after the lead singer has passed on and the band has broken up and who is this band you might be wondering?

Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia \. ( TRACK AND MUSIC) quote
And because of that, it made the Grateful Dead, the most successful touring act of all time. So your C chord, you have to be the ones driving the change. And to do that, that's going to mean changing intentionally on a regular basis. And you're going to have to be the only one that does what you do. So how can you create that kind of bond with your fans, with your customers? And are you the only one who does what you do? Alright, jazz hands ready, and the crowd goes wild. Whoa, whoa, thank you,

Put the drumsticks together, let's walk into the stage or B chord. Can't hear you.

43:11  
. Just like in a band and your business . If you want to achieve your BUD and constantly be the ones driving the change, you have to surround yourself with the right kind of people, create the right kind of working relationships and culture so that everyone plays nicely together. And while that synergy may seem easy, it's really not. 
As leaders, you have to create that safe environment. You have to make sure that everyone feels safe and comfortable speaking up, sharing ideas and they're not going to be made fun of or pushed down. Or that they need  permission to get on  stage. Let them go for it. That's how you're going to keep your people engaged. That's how you're going to solve the great resignation. That's how you're gonna keep them energized and make them feel like they have purpose and that they can change the industry together. Now I put together three key points to keep your band fine tuned high strung and operating at a higher level every day. First one is you have to put the band first. Legendary frontman Steven Tyler from the band Aerosmith said as good as I am. I am nothing without my band. Even with a big giant ego, he knows ya gotta do what's best for the team. Do what's best for the Band. Number two, you have to honor everyone's unique abilities. Now in a band, some people are upfront and very noticeable like the lead singer.
( mark does audience bit)
while others like the bass player, barely get noticed at all, but a smart Rockstar makes sure that everyone in the band gets honored. Raise your left drumstick if you know who Bill Wyman is . Okay, Mark, good job five people. raise your right drumstick if you know who Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones is? Yeah, just about everybody. Well, Bill Wyman was the original bass player for the Rolling Stones and interviews with Jagger about the stones he goes on and on and on about what a great bass player Bill Wyman is. And guess what. That's why the stones are still together. They're all members of AARP. But they're still together. Their tour bus goes 30 miles an hour in the left lane down the freeway with the blinker on. But they're still together. And the same is true for you and yours. You have to allow each person to play out his or her part and then honor that person for their contribution. It's been said  about the Rolling Stones that Mick Jagger makes them famous. And Keith Richards, their guitars, makes them a band. And some of you make your bands famous, while others make it work  on a day by day basis. And there has to be a realization that you all play an important part to the success of your team, and that everyone should be honored for that contribution. So my question is, who are your bass players? When was the last time you thanked them? Gave them a gift card? pat on the back? So I'm gonna give a shout out to some of our bass players, (recognize av and crew)

Some bands like U2, they go on and become legendary. But other bands, actually most bands, break up. And what is it class that almost always breaks up bands? EGO
 Who said Yoko. Really? Okay, it's ego except when it's Yoko. But what keeps a band together is humility. A band leader that isn't overcome with the ego and knows that the band is better together. Okay, we're on The Final Countdown so everybody come with me Final Countdown here we go
( audience hums final countdown)

50:31  
and welcome to the stage your a chord 
.

50:46  
Okay, maybe not that kind of action. Here's the deal, you can have the biggest bud in the world, you can see the change that you have to drive, you can have the most awesome band members. But none of that means anything without your a chord. And A stands for what class?  Action taking daily massive action is the only thing that will take you to your bud. So Whenever I plan my day or my week,, I'll get out an old school legal pad, I call it a legal pad AI  but you can do this on your computer or mobile device. And I draw a line right down to the middle. On one side I put a top 10 list. On the other side, I put my Top three. And then I write down everything that I want to accomplish for that day or for that week. Then I have an audition and only the things in my top 10 list that are directly connected to my D chord, my bud, get into the top three list. And if I have more than three, then I audition them and pick out the most important three. And then you do those first. Now I have a shortcut or a hack. When I'm doing my audition and I'm going down that top 10 list. I look at each line item. And I say to myself if it's not a Hell yeah, or a rock on, then it's a no. And it doesn't get in the Top three list. Sometimes people ask, Mark, why only three? Well, Jim Collins did the research for you. And the scientific data is there and I'm, I'd be happy to share it with you later on. But he says if you have more than three priorities, you don't have any, your bandwidth is too thin. You're busy and not productive. But I love this quote from Gary Keller, . He said, If you could get only one thing done today, and it made all of your other tasks unnecessary, what would it be? Then do that now.

A bond so strong that it still exists to this day, even after the lead singer has passed on and the band has broken up and who is this band you might be wondering? It's none other than The Grateful Dead! And because of that, it made the Grateful Dead, the most successful touring act of all time. So your C chord, you have to be the ones driving the change. And to do that, that's going to mean changing intentionally on a regular basis. And you're going to have to be the only one that does what you do. So how can you create that kind of bond with your fans, with your customers? And are you the only one who does what you do?

But what keeps a band together is humility - a band leader that isn't overcome with ego and knows that they're better together. So I put together three key points to keep your band fine tuned high strung and operating at a higher level every day: Put the band first; honor everyone's unique abilities; and take daily action towards your BUD (Big Ugly Dream). Now I have a shortcut or hack: When I'm doing my audition for tasks each day or week, I look at each line item - if it's not a Hell yeah or rock on then it's a no! And if I have more than three priorities then I audition them and pick out my top three - those get done first! And finally, let me leave you with this Gary Keller quote: "If you could get only one thing done today, and it made all of your other tasks unnecessary, what would it be? Then do that now." So my question is: Who are your bass players? When was the last time you thanked them? Gave them a gift card? Pat on the back? Let's give them all a round of applause!
