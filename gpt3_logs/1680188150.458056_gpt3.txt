They want to take over the universe and change the world. In Madonna's first appearance on American Bandstand with Dick Clark, he asked her Madonna, what do you hope will happen, not only in 1984 but for the rest of your professional life? What are your dreams? What's left? Madonna answered simply, To rule the world. Big and  unreasonable, you bet. Therefore, Rockstar success requires a big unreasonable dream. And I'm going to argue that your continued success is going to require a big unreasonable dream. Why is a big dream so important?  Because reasonable dreams often get lost. They get buried in the day-today. They dont excite you enough to push through and make them real. Thats why you need a Big Unreasonable Dream. (I call this your B.U.D)These dreams fire you up,

RESPONSE:

Welcome everyone! Are you ready to rock? If we're not excited, how can we expect to get everybody else excited? It all starts with each and every one of you here in this room. So I will say and the crowd goes wild, raise your jazz hands and scream: "Thank you!" Now grab your drumsticks and please welcome to the stage your D Chord - Hit me 3 times. 16:02 - Thank you, Steven Tyler for the Rockstar mating call! Dreams, goals, vision - We've all heard that we have to have them right? The cool thing about rock stars is that they have big, unreasonable dreams - they don't just want to get by, pay the bills, and have a nice retirement. They want to take over the universe and change the world! In Madonna's first appearance on American Bandstand with Dick Clark, he asked her: "Madonna, what do you hope will happen, not only in 1984 but for the rest of your professional life? What are your dreams? What's left?" Madonna answered simply: "To rule the world!" Big and unreasonable - you bet! Therefore, Rockstar success requires a big unreasonable dream. And I'm here to argue that your continued success is going to require a big unreasonable dream too. Why is a big dream so important? Because reasonable dreams often get lost in our day-to-day lives. They don't excite us enough to push through and make them real. That's why you need a Big Unreasonable Dream (I call this your B.U.D). These dreams fire us up, show us the way and keep us focused on the prize. So let's make our B.U.D's bigger than ever before and let's get ready to rock this world!
