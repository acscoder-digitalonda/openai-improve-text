Improve this speech to have more structure and jokes from the fun quick witted speaker:

but for demonstration purposes, okay. Drummers leadership, they set the beat the tone and the foundation for the rest of the band to follow. If the drummer is off the whole companies off. Usually your CEO, President, your executive leaders, VP of Operations, and sometimes in your own department, if you have a lot of people, you're the drummer. Okay, so drumming section, these two tables, you're gonna put your sticks in both hands, and you got to pound on the table on a one and a three. I'll go 56781 and three, and one and three, hit them hard. One, and three, and one and three. hit them hard. One, and three. And one and three.  1:02:47   Stop right there.  1:02:49   hold that beat in your mind. Now on this side of the room. We have the bass players are unsung heroes. Yes. You know, song would be pretty lame without a good thumping baseline. You know, we said the bass players are not always upfront and seen. But we got to have bass in our song, right? It's all about the bass. So your unsung heroes in your world could be it. Facilities, accounting, delivery teams, EA sometimes shipping receiving the mailroom vendors, trainers, third party people like that. Those are your bass player. And I'm sure you can probably think of a few more. So bass players, I want you to hold your stick and the left hand about halfway up. You're going to strike with your right on a two and a four. It's going to be two and four and two, and four. Don't forget to smile when you smile for no reason.

RESPONSE:

Good evening everyone! I'm here to talk about drummers and bass players, and their importance in the world of business. Drummers are the leadership in their respective bands, providing the beat, tone, and foundation for everyone else to follow. As a CEO, President, Executive Leader, or VP of Operations, you could be considered the drummer in your organization. So let's try it out! Put your sticks in both hands and pound on the table on a one and a three. Let's go 5-6-7-8-1-and-3, hit them hard! Now for our unsung heroes of the room - the bass players! A song would be pretty dull without a good thumping baseline. So think of your unsung heroes - Facilities, Accounting, Delivery Teams, EA's, Shipping & Receiving, Mailroom Vendors, Trainers, Third Party People - they are all your bass players. Hold your stick in the left hand halfway up and strike with your right hand on two and four - two and four - don't forget to smile when you do it! So don't forget folks - drummers provide the beat and bass players provide the thumping baseline that we all need to keep us going. Now let's put it all together and make some music!
